## Technical Writing One
### Words
* provide link to definition or define and add to your own glossary
* be consistent with names (don't rename)
* define thing then give acronym (all in bold), eg: **Nance Instance (NI)** is used to...NI is great...

### Active voice
* cctive voice sentence = actor + verb + target
* passive voice sentence = target + verb + actor
* imperative verb (command) sentences are active, actor is implied as YOU
* use passive sparingly

### Clear sentences
* use strong verbs, occur and happen are weak
* avoid there is/are at beginning of sentence
* avoid flashy adjectives, this is more marketing than technical
